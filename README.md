# My Personal WordPress Resume Website Hosted on Github

Demo resume website [here:](https://tanyongsheng.xyz)

WordPress is a drag-and-drop website editor which generate dynamic websites. But, since Github can only host static website without any backend available, 
WordPress as a dynamic website shall not work properly when hosted in Github. Thus, to have it hosted on Github, I need to convert this dynamic WordPress website
to a static one using [simply static](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simply-static/) plugin in WordPress. 

## Benefits of serving WordPress as static site
1. Less server cost, if for low needs, you might get it FREE (e.g., use Github or Netlify to host the static website)!
2. The static site runs faster than dynamic site.

## Cons of serving WordPress as static site
1. More steps to deploy or update the changes, not beginner friendly - With dynamic website, you just need to access the backend (or wp-admin) to use the drag and drop editor to
amend website. But, since static website does not deploy that backend (or wp-admin) online, so you can only amend and update your content on localhost, and then upload everytime the static 
part of website to your host (e.g., Github) for every update. 
2. Easier to lose your data - since you edit and update your WordPress on localhost, you would lose your data if you don't backup your localhost WordPress yourself (such as `wp-content` folder, 
`wp-config` file and your sql file exported from phpmyadmin).

## How I serve this WordPress website as static one?
- What I basically do is I install WordPress on localhost using *XAMPP*. Install *simply-static* plugin to convert dynamic WordPress website to static site.
And then I create a *new Github repository* and *Github Pages* setup where the finished static website will be uploaded to.

*Plugins Used:*
1. [`Simply Static`](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simply-static/) -> my go-to plugin to convert WordPress website to static one. 
2. [`Elementor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/)` -> This is the DRAG AND DROP WEBSITE EDITOR to create beautiful webpage.
3. [`Blocksy Companion`](https://wordpress.org/plugins/blocksy-companion/) -> A companion for Blocksy theme. I am using it since I am using Blocksy theme for this project.
4. [`Starter Templates`](https://wordpress.org/plugins/astra-sites/) -> Used together with Elementor, because inside got many templates available for Elementor to use. 
5. [`Code Snippet`](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/) -> Simple to run additional css, html on the website.
